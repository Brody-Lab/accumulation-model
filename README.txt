Hello! 

This code package implements an analytical solution to a drift-diffusion-advection 
(linear feedback) model for pulse-based evidence. It can be used to do model 
fitting via maximum likelihood estimation. In addition, it can compute the 
so-called backwards pass distribution which gives a better estimation of the
latent variable at each time point by using the final choice of the agent. 

For questions, please contact alexpiet@gmail.com. This code is being provided
for the community, and is not documented as well as it code me. Sorry!

I've attached one sample datafile "H033.mat" which is rat from Piet et al, Nature Communications, 2018
